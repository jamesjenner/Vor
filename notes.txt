Add widget:
  Title (fixed)
  Widget Type (fixed)
  Widget Params (dynamic)
  Data Source (fixed)
  Data to Widget map (dynamic)

Add data source
  Name (fixed)
  Type (VersionOne, Jenkins, SFDC, etc) (fixed)
  Data specific info e.g.
    Credentials (dynamic)

Data sources:


Change add widget wizard from choosing display type of widget to driven based on data.

For example: Choose Version One data set, then presented options are what makes sense for Version One:
* overall progress
* progress by state
* number of blockers
* burn down
* burn up
* etc

Then the presentation mode can be decided. Some may not have any options. E.g. progress could be a value, bar graph, progress gauge, etc. But burn down/up can only be a graph (possibly).

Also need to factor in data mapping. Should it be restricted to a selection of data retreived from V1, e.g. team selection, or manualy code?

Should default data source to last data source utilised for the panel? So if a v1 data source was previously added then keep defaulting until changed?

The above approach avoids the problem of a user having to understand how best to setup an agile panel. 

--------------

Look at adding default panel types. E.g. choose add panel, choose templates, choose data source and then possibly one more type.
